# 使用 Golang 打造 Web 應用程式

這本書是專為 Golang 新手開發者所寫，原始內容皆來自 [Build Web Application with Golang](https://github.com/astaxie/build-web-application-with-golang) 專案，感謝所有貢獻者的付出與努力，希望大家會喜歡。

## Purpose

Because I'm interested in web application development, I used my free time to write this book as an open source version. It doesn't mean that I have a very good ability to build web applications; I would like to share what I've done with Go in building web applications.

* For those of you who are working with PHP/Python/Ruby, you will learn how to build a web application with Go.
* For those of you who are working with C/C++, you will know how the web works.

I believe the purpose of studying is sharing with others. The happiest thing in my life is sharing everything I've known with more people.
